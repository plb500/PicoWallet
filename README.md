# PicoWallet
Code for an HD (Hierarchical Deterministic) hardware wallet implementation on the Raspberry Pico. Can generate full hierearchy of derived keys either by generating new seed (using Pico's on board entropy sources) or from hard-coded seed. Also generates QR codes for importing private keys

TODO:
- MicroSD card integration
- Screen/button input
